This directory contains tools (with tests) for generating JNI bindings.
golden_sample_for_tests_jni.h is a golden file, checked in so that the
tests can ensure the generator is working properly.

sample_for_tests.cc and JavaSampleForTests.java are samples that are
used to test the generator end-to-end and compile the generated code
in a native executable.

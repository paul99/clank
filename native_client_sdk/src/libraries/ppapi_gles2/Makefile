# Default configuration
#
# By default we will build a Debug configuration using the GCC newlib toolcahin
# to override this, specify TOOLCHAIN=newlib|glibc or CONFIG=Debug|Release on
# the make command-line or in this file prior to including common.mk.  The
# toolchain we use by default will be the first valid one listed
VALID_TOOLCHAINS:=newlib glibc pnacl linux win

# Get pepper directory for toolchain and includes.

# If NACL_SDK_ROOT is not set, then assume it can be found relative to

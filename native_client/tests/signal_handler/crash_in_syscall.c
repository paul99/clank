   * There are two possible kinds of fault in trusted code:
   *  1) Faults legitimately triggered by untrusted code.  These are
   *     safe and do not indicate a bug.
   *  2) Faults caused by bugs in trusted code.
   *
   * Currently the signal handler does not distinguish between the
   * two.  Ultimately, we do want to distinguish between them in order
   * to avoid misleading bug reports.
   * See http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=579
   *
   * Below, we trigger a memory access fault in trusted code, inside a
   * syscall handler.  The imc_recvmsg() implementation does a
   * memcpy() from the address we give it.  This is an instance of
   * (1).  If we later extend the system to distinguish (1) and (2),
   * we will want to add a separate test case for (2).
   *
   * We use 0x1000 because we know that is unmapped.  (If this changes
   * and the call fails to fault, the test runner will catch that.)
   * We don't use NULL because the syscall checks for NULL.

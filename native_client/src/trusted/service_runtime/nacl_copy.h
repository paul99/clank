/*
 * NaClCopyInFromUser copies a region of memory starting at
 * |src_usr_addr| of length |num_bytes| to a target buffer at
 * |dst_sys_ptr|, which is a pointer (in kernel/system address space).
 * The |src_usr_addr| is in user addresses and is checked to ensure
 * that it resides within the user's address space.  If it is not, 0
 * (false) is returned.  Otherwise, the address is properly translated
 * and the copy attempted.  Note that we do not (currently) check
 * whether the source memory region is actually mapped, so a trusted
 * code fault may occur.  If the function returns successfully, it
 * returns non-zero (true).  NB: the caller needs to translate failure
 * to -NACL_ABI_EFAULT or -NACL_ABI_EINVAL as appropriate.  (In Unix,
 * EFAULT is for when the syscall handler immediately uses the address
 * and is generated by triggering the kernel fault handler.)
 *
 * NB: |src_usr_addr| should be a 32-bit quantity and typically user
 * addresses are stored in 32-bit variables.  However, we accept an
 * uintptr_t since on 64-bit systems we may have relying code that
 * saved an user address in a 64-bit variable, and if such a value
 * were clobbered so that the low-order 32-bits would validate in
 * checks done here and elsewhere (due to the integral type narrowing)
 * but the high-order 32-bits are non-zero, and the relying code,
 * after having used the NaClCopy functions assumed that the value has
 * been checked and then uses it directly, then declaring the formal
 * parameter |src_usr_addr| as an uint32_t would not detect the error
 * but declaring it as uintptr_t would.

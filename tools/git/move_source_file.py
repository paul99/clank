"""Moves a C++ file to a new location, updating any include paths that
point to it, and re-ordering headers as needed.  Updates include
guards in moved header files.  Assumes Chromium coding style.

Attempts to update paths used in .gyp(i) files, but does not reorder
or restructure .gyp(i) files in any way.

Updates full-path references to files in // comments in source files.

Must run in a git checkout, as it relies on git grep for a fast way to
find files that reference the moved file.
